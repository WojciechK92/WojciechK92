# Hi, I'm Wojciech! ðŸ‘‹

I am aspiring to become a web developer. My dream is to become a backend developer, and who knows, maybe even a full-stack developer.

## ðŸš€ About Me

For the past 5 years, my work has involved designing machines and robotic production lines using Siemens control and Fanuc robots. Collaborating with machine programmers during project implementation instilled in me a passion for programming, which became the catalyst for a difficult but necessary decision to change industries.

My experience includes the implementation of large, complex, and innovative projects. My career path attests to the fact that I am a responsible and committed individual. I can accept constructive criticism, admit mistakes, and ask others for help.

Currently, I am focusing on learning programming and exploring new technologies, dedicating all my time to it.
