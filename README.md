# Hi, I'm Wojciech! ðŸ‘‹

I aspire to become a web developer. My dream is to become a backend developer, and who knows, maybe even a full-stack developer.

## ðŸš€ About Me

For the past 5 years, I have been designing machines and robotic production lines using Siemens control and Fanuc robots. 

Collaborating with machine programmers during project implementation instilled in me a passion for programming, which became the catalyst for a difficult but necessary decision to change industries. 
My experience includes the implementation of large, complex, and innovative projects. My career path attests to the fact that I am a responsible and committed individual. I can accept constructive criticism, admit mistakes, and ask others for help.

Currently, I am focusing on learning programming and exploring new technologies, dedicating all my time to it. With passion and determination, I am gaining practical experience in many technologies crucial for backend development, including Java, Spring, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, as well as front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and React. I am deeply convinced that the knowledge and skills I have acquired, combined with my passion for programming, provide a solid foundation that will allow me to perform my duties as a Junior Backend Developer diligently, efficiently, and professionally.
